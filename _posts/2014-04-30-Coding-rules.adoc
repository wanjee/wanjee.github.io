== What to do ?

Whatever the framework or CMS we use we will apply the coding standards provided by their developers.

* Drupal: http://drupal.org/coding-standards
* Symfony: http://symfony.com/doc/master/contributing/code/standards.html
* Other PHP libraries: http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/


So depending on the project you work on you should configure your IDE or text editor properly.  In Eclipse you can work with 2 distinct workspaces (Drupal and Symfony) with their respective settings.  In PHPStorm you can set your project coding rules by loading predefined styles.

== Why it's important ?

We all speak the same language but we use different dialects.  We should share same language and dialect to ease code readability, maintainability, efficiency,â€¦
