== What to do ?


We take lots from the community:

* frameworks: Drupal, Symfony, Zend Framework…
* modules: Views, Features…
* libraries: jQuery,…

But we do not give something back so often and that's not really how a community should work.

We could (and should) do the following for the community:

Fast and easy part:

* Report bugs and answer to related questions and remarks
* Test and report test results of applied community patches
* Test and report test results of alpha, beta and release candidate


The following probably needs to be discussed internally (it involves intellectual property, code ownership and maintenance responsibility,…):

* Contribute our custom developments
* Help maintenance of existing contributed modules seeking for maintainer or co-maintainer
* Write tests for existing modules/core
* Take part to the discussions about core evolution

== Why it's important ?

A community is built thanks to the guys building it.  Building something is the best way to learn exactly how it works.
